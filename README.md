âœ¨ #Day49 of #100DaysChallenge

Hey everyone!

ðŸš€ I've built a dynamic dessert cart system using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It was so challenging ðŸ¥µ

âœ… Highlights:

Add/Remove Items: Easily add and remove dessert items from your cart.

Quantity Control: Adjust the quantity of each item with increment and decrement buttons.

Real-Time Updates: Cart count and total price update instantly as you add or remove items.

Confirmation: Displays a confirmation message when the order is placed, but I didn't finish it for now.

Interactive UI: Provides a smooth user experience with intuitive controls.

The system is fully functional and provides a seamless experience!  I know there are some issues, but I'll take care of them soonðŸ˜Š

ðŸ’ª Excited to keep pushing forward and improving! ðŸ’»
